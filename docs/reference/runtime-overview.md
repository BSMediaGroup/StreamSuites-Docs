Reference

This reference page is a placeholder for runtime concepts.

## Coming soon

This page will document runtime services, lifecycle states, and operational notes.

* Runtime roles and surface areas.
* Lifecycle events and monitoring cues.
* Operational checklists for launches.

## Looking for the new structure?

Runtime documentation is now grouped into overview, exports, and automation states.

* [Runtime overview](../runtime/runtime-overview.html)
* [Exports and versioning](../runtime/exports-and-versioning.html)
* [Automation states](../runtime/automation-states.html)
