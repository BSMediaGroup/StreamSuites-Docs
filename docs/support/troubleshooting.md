## Billing and payments

### Payment declined

- Likely cause: The card issuer declined the charge, or billing details do not match the card on file.
- What to do: Confirm the card number, expiration date, and billing address, then retry with the same or a different card.
- Contact support when: The card is valid and accepted elsewhere, but StreamSuites still declines after verifying details.

### Card expired

- Likely cause: The saved card has passed its expiration date.
- What to do: Update the card with a current expiration date and retry the payment.
- Contact support when: You updated the card and still see an expiration error on the next attempt.

### Subscription shows past-due

- Likely cause: A recent payment did not complete or the card on file is no longer valid.
- What to do: Update your payment method and submit the outstanding payment in your billing portal.
- Contact support when: Payment shows completed with your bank, but the subscription remains past-due for more than 24 hours.

### Charged but access not updated

- Likely cause: The payment completed, but the account update is still processing.
- What to do: Sign out and back in, then check access again after a short wait.
- Contact support when: Access has not updated after 24 hours and the charge is settled on your statement.
